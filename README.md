# CIS Final Project (Fall 2018)

For our final project, we chose to tackle Case No. 3, The Vignere Cipher. The VigenÃ¨re cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It is a form of *polyalphabetic* substitution. Our program takes plaintext and a keyword from the user and utilizes the Vigenere cipher to produce ciphertext. Users also have the option to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted using the Vignere cipher. Our program is written in C++ and took about 1 week to complete.

## Getting Started

You will need a web-based IDE such as [repl](https://repl.it/) or [cpp.sh](cpp.sh). Copy the contents of "Project.final_version.cpp" into the IDE and compile.

Alternatively you can clone this repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and run the "Project.final_version.cpp" found in the master branch using a compiler of choice. We used [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) and the *g++* command.

```
git clone https://github.com/conocolo/CIS7FinalProject/
cd /User/User/Documents/GitHub/CIS7FinalProject/

dir

g++ Project.final_version.cpp
```

## Runnning The Program

The menu is pretty straight forward. It will ask for a keyword and input a keyword of choice.

This program demonstrates Vignere Encryption and Decryption!


Creating Vignere class...
Calling Vignere::menu...
Loaded...

Welcome! Please enter a Keyword: PANDA

Keyword set to: PANDA
```

After entering you keyword, it will be stored and used throughout the program until changed. Press **1** to change the KEYWORD. The menu is programmed to display the current keyword.

```
Please select an option:
1) Change Keyword
   >>Current Key: PANDA
2) Encrypt
3) Decrypt
4) Exit
>>Enter Option:  
```
With your keyword set, you are ready to encrypt or decrypt. Select **2** for Encryption or **3** for decryption. After entering your plaintext (or ciphertext when decrypting) the program will produce the corresponding result. 

```
Please select an option:
1) Change Keyword
   >>Current Key: PANDA
2) Encrypt
3) Decrypt
4) Exit
>>Enter Option: 2

Please enter plaintext to be encrypted: FLYINGSPAGHETTIMONSTER
Passed your plaintext, FLYINGSPAGHETTIMONSTER, to get encrypted...
Plaintext length: 22
Keyword length: 5
New keyword: PANDAPANDAPANDAPANDAPA
Cipher text: ULLLNVSCDGWEGWIBOAVTTR
```

The program will continue until the user presses **4** to exit. 

```
Please select an option:
1) Change Keyword
   >>Current Key: PANDAPA
2) Encrypt
3) Decrypt
4) Exit
>>Enter Option: 4

## Documentation

*By Devan*
When reviewing the different the cases on Day 1 of the project, Randy and I immediately had our eyes set on Case 3: The Vignere Cipher. As a cryptologist, it was the most appealing. I wanted to tackle the encryption algorithm and have it operate like the Enigma Machine, an encryption machine used by Nazi Germany during World War II. We scrapped that idea and ended up formulating our encryption/decryption based off the [IMAGE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Vigen%C3%A8re_square_shading.png) shown in the rubric. 

During our first meeting, we composed our psuedocode on a piece of paper. We wanted to incorporate a menu based command-line interface and have it loop until the user stops the program. That way the user is not constantly starting up the program. Our menu would include options for both encryption and decryption. Randy got to work on coding the encryption algoritm and I began the writing the menu. I based the menu off a another project I wrote in the Python Language. From there everything came to place with more and more. 

### Known Issues

* Plaintext entries cannot have a space.
* Menu does not work well when you enter letters.

## Built With

* [repl](https://repl.it/) - Primary IDE
* [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Secondary IDE
* [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) - Compiler used in conjunction with Microsoft Visual Code.
