# CIS Final Project (Fall 2018)

For our final project, we chose to tackle Case No. 3, The Vignere Cipher. Our program takes plaintext and a keyword and uses the Vigenere cipher to produce ciphertext. The program is written in C++ and took about 2 weeks to complete.
## Getting Started

You will need a web-based IDE such as [repl](https://repl.it/) or [cpp.sh](cpp.sh). Copy the contents of "Project.final_version.cpp" into the IDE and compile.

Alternatively you can clone this repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and run the "Project.final_version.cpp" found in the master branch using a compiler of choice. We used [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) and the *g++* command

```
git clone https://github.com/conocolo/CIS7FinalProject/
cd /User/User/Documents/GitHub/CIS7FinalProject/

dir

g++ Project.final_version.cpp
```


### Known Issues
* Plaintext entries cannot have a space.
* Menu does not work well when you enter letters.


## Built With

* [repl](https://repl.it/) - Primary IDE
* [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Secondary IDE
* [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) - Compiler used in conjunction with Microsoft Visual Code.
