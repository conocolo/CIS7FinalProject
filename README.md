# CIS Final Project

For our final project, we chose to tackle Case No. 3, The Vignere Cipher. Our program takes plaintext and a keyword and uses the Vigenere cipher to produce ciphertext. The program is written in C++ and took about 2 weeks to complete.
## Getting Started

You will need a web-based IDE such as [repl](https://repl.it/) or [cpp.sh](cpp.sh). Copy the contents of "Project.final_version.cpp" into the IDE and compile.
